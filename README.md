# MICROCONTROLLER-BASED-THRUST-VECTOR-CONTROL-OF-GIMBAL-USING-PID-CONTROLLER
A microcontroller-based thrust vector control (TVC) system using a gimbal and PID controller. Utilizes IMU feedback (e.g., MPU6050) to stabilize rocket or UAV thrust direction in real-time via servo motors. Ideal for low-cost aerospace, rocketry, and control system experiments.

About
This project presents the development of a real-time thrust vector control (TVC) system designed to stabilize aerospace vehicles by dynamically adjusting thrust direction through a closed-loop PID control architecture. The system integrates an ESP32-WROOM-38 microcontroller with an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU) to continuously monitor pitch and roll angles, utilizing fused accelerometer and gyroscope data for robust attitude estimation. A complementary filter combines the high-frequency response of gyroscopic data with the low-frequency stability of accelerometer readings, ensuring accurate orientation feedback even under dynamic conditions. The PID control algorithm processes these measurements to generate corrective signals, which drive SG90 servo motors mounted on a custom 3D-printed gimbal assembly, redirecting the thrust vector to counteract instability. Mechanical constraints limit gimbal movement to ±45°, preventing over-correction while maintaining control.

The implementation emphasizes cost-effectiveness and scalability, leveraging off-the-shelf components to achieve performance comparable to higher-end systems. Empirical tuning of PID gains optimizes response times and minimizes overshoot, validated through iterative testing under simulated disturbances. Results demonstrate the system’s ability to autonomously stabilize orientation deviations, highlighting its potential for educational prototypes, small-scale rockets, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). By bridging theoretical control principles with practical hardware integration, this project underscores the viability of embedded PID controllers for real-time aerospace applications and provides a foundational framework for future advancements in adaptive TVC systems.
