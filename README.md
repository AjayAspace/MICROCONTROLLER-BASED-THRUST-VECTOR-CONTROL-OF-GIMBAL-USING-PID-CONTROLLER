# MICROCONTROLLER-BASED-THRUST-VECTOR-CONTROL-OF-GIMBAL-USING-PID-CONTROLLER
A microcontroller-based thrust vector control (TVC) system using a gimbal and PID controller. Utilizes IMU feedback (e.g., MPU6050) to stabilize rocket or UAV thrust direction in real-time via servo motors. Ideal for low-cost aerospace, rocketry, and control system experiments.
